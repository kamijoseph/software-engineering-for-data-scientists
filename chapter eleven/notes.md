# chapter eleven: APIs
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are an important part of modern software engineering.
- APIs allow two systems to communicate and transfer data.
- they hide the details of your code behind a standard way of accessing a system, providing a useful layer of abstraction.
- many large software products use APIs to exchange data internally, and they’re particularly important in web development.
- an API lets you programmatically access some data or perform some  action. one of the first places you may come across an API is trying to download some data from a public API.
- they are an example of client and server communications. the server sits and waits for something to contact it, and the client is the one doing the contacting. the client requests some data from the server, and the server shares that data. web APIs generally use HTTP to make a request, then return a response as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML file.
