# chapter ten: sharing code: version control, dependencies, and packaging
- sharing your code and collaborating with others is hugely important to your success in data science. you might join an existing project that has a large codebase. You might start by working on your code in isolation, but as your project grows, you may want to share it with others so that they don’t need to solve the same problems as well. or you could be contributing to open source projects.
- you’ll need to know some tools and techniques that make it easier for multiple people to work on the same code.
- version control is important because it’s the standard way of collaborating on a codebase.

## version control using git
- version control is a way of tracking what changes have been made to a codebase, and it allows multiple people to work on the same code easily.
- lets you see who made what changes to the code, and it prevents conflicts if two people are working on the same line of code.
- if someone makes a change that causes a bug, or you make a mistake in your code, it’s easy to go back to the previous version of the code.
