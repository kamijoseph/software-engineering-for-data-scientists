# chapter twelve: automation and deployment
- automating your coding processes helps ensure they are standardized and reproducible.
- you can make sure that your code is always linted, formatted, and tested before it reaches a production system, or even before it is committed to version control.
- automation also helps ensure that your processes are standard across your team. if tests are automated, everyone is more likely to run them, and there will be fewer mistakes in the team’s code. This can help you set up a culture of writing good code within your team.
