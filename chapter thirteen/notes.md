# chapter thirteen: security
- the data you work with may include people’s personal data (which may be personally identifiable information, or PII). it could also include data that is important to your company’s business, such as financial data or data about how many customers your company has.
- this type of data can harm users and your company if it is exposed publicly.

## what is security
- security for software is concerned with protecting a system from theft of information, damage, disruption, or unwanted access to information.
- an attacker wishes to gain access to a system and use data within for some purpose that the holder of that data doesn’t want, or data is accidentally exposed in some way that it can be accessed by the public.
- security may be evaluated relative to external standards or to fulfill guarantees made to customers. Your company may comply with standards such as ISO 27001 or follow a framework from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology.

## security risks
- these are some examples of security risks that you should be aware of in your work as a data scientist. This is not an exhaustive list, but these are some of the risks you’re more likely to come across: 

    ### credentials, physical security and social engineering
    - this risk isn’t specific to Python or data science coding, but a common cause of security breaches is from an attacker getting access to an employee’s login credentials to company systems.
    -this can be done via an attack on physical security, for example, stealing company hardware, or via social engineering, for example, phishing emails.
