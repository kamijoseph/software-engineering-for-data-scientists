# chapter eight: design and refractoring
- in this chapter we will explore: how to design projects, how to arrange the code, refractoring code when the design changes.
- it will include ideas for how to organize and standardize the high level structure of the projects and breaking code into modular, reusable functions.
- good design, whether at the level of a whole project or at the level of indivindual functions has a number of benefits:
    1. if the project is standardized, it removes some of the mental load of switching from one project to another
    2. it is easier to reuse pieces of the code in other projects.
    3. it is easier to add new features.
- refractoring is the process of adjusting the structure of the code while keeping its behavior the same and this is a normal part of software engineering.
